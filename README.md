Kairos is a generative AI-powered scheduling app that integrates seamlessly with Google/Apple
Calendar. After optimizing, the details are pushed back to Google/Apple Calendar.

Users can input tasks, and the app dynamically optimizes their schedule by
considering task durations, commute times, and personal preferences. 

By leveraging GPTâ€™s advanced natural language processing, the app can also interpret flexible user inputs like "finish
report before Friday" or "schedule a gym session every other day."

Further, It also allows to optimize events and tasks according to priority, and distance between tasks to reduce travel time

Model: OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4

Language: SwiftUI, Swift, JSON.

Improvements to be made in the next few months: More Usable UI,
